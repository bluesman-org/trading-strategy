# Installation & Backtest QA Artifacts

Store evidence here for SC-006 proving the Pine Script compiles and backtests cleanly on 15m, 1h, and 4h charts.

Recommended contents:
- `15m/`, `1h/`, `4h/` subfolders with Strategy Tester HTML exports or screenshots.
- Notes.txt describing any compile warnings and their resolution.
- Optional CSV exports summarizing drawdown and allocation checks per timeframe.

Ensure each artifact references the git commit and TradingView chart settings used during capture.
